### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, Part 3 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time we made a playable game. Sure, looking back, this game code could be improved upon, but nonetheless I remember having a great feeling when I ran this code and it worked.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was a great lab because it really challenged me when it came to using the different boolean functions to run the blackjack code. I already love blackjack so being able to code my own blackjack game was awesome to do and at the end it felt super rewarding to run the code.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, Part 2 was a great lab because it was the same Hi-Lo game from lab 3, part 3, but this time more complex. It felt like a culmination everything we learned throughout the semester and I remember coding this lab and remembering having to code this game at the start of the semester and remembering how much different it was.
